# CLEAR-graph (Chemistry and Local Environment Adaptive Representation graphs)

A featurisation tool that automatically integrates the chemistry of atoms with its local atomic environment forming an universal chemistry-weighted crystal graph descriptor. It takes the structure file (.cif/.vasp) as input to generate the descriptors.
